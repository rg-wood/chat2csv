,speech,,"The fish broth Biron prepares goes down easier than the seagull. And guards against the chilling night are creeping into the cave. You all feel the warmth of a good meal sitting in your guts as the weariness of your limbs commands attention."

gm
,speech,,"Biron seems to fall asleep immediately, as is his manner. Soon followed by a weary Quinn. And so Orin's watch begins."

player,,"Quinn"
,action,,,"grunts and dons his armour then slumps down in the low entryway with his bow over his lap."

gm
,speech,,"The sound of whistling is getting closer... and higher... it appears to be coming from the cliffs above: someone walking along the coastal path?"
,speech,,"But who would be travelling at this hour?"
player,,"Biron"
,action,,,"puts finger to his lips and pulls his shield off his back. presses against the walls of the cave."

player,,"Biron"
,speech,,"Let me try. you keep your bow on me."
gm
,speech,,"Now that Biron mentions it, it does sound familiar to Quinn. Perhaps a seafaring shanty, though Quinn cannot quite put his finger on which."

,action,,,"looks at Biron with concern."
,speech,,"Okay."
player,,"Biron"
,action,,,"nods to him."
gm
,speech,,"You can now see a glow coming from the bluffs above, as though from a lantern."
,speech,,"It wavers about in the air, as though the holder is walking ."
player,,"Quinn"
,partial,,"Sounds a bit like 'the fisherman's daughter'. You know it? It's a bit of a bawdy song, and no mistake. You'd know the chorus - makes it clear that shes the easiest catch some...","scratches his head"

player,,"Biron"
,action,,,"stays low and stays close to the rock face."
gm
,speech,,"Coming along the coastal path you spy what appears to be a man wearing a tricorn hat. He carries a lantern hanging from the end of a long pole."

player,,"Biron"
,action,,,"crouches low to the ground and behind some rocks and bushes and keeps an eye on them."
gm
,speech,,"As he approaches you can see the man is clearly much enjoying his stroll. He swings his arm and steps forward as though without a care in the world, in tune to the crow's whistling."
,speech,,"A nasty looking mace hangs from his belt, but then who wouldn't carry a weapon in such a remote spot as this?"
player,,"Biron"
,action,,,"looks for any tattoos, symbols or markings on the stranger or his weapons."
gm
,speech,,"Nothing else untoward. He bears leather armour, and a coat that has seen better days. Its pockets jangle, perhaps with coin?"
