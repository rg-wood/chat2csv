<dt>Ba'Raknul</dt>
<dd>Er, nothing.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">pauses then sits back to relaxin and preparing food.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">gives Biron a confused look, then turns to Quinn.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>Em sighs ''Last time I was this close to the ocean I was fishing me'self out of it. Pirates you see... damn cut throats and scallywags every one of em.''</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I guess... I'm glad for you?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">sighs</span> ... I almost wish I hadn't joined em.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">raises an eyebrow at Quinn.</p>
  <p>You do have an awful lot of stories.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">bows his head</span> Part of the joy of being without a roof over the head. Tends to blow a man around like a leaf on the wind.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">cooks up the crabs and fish. and squashes the berry into a jam/juice.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">smiles</span> Course, now I've found meself a loving family in the Griffon, and no mistake. Blessed I am, for sure.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I suppose. I hadn't any experience like that until a couple months ago.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">raises an eyebrow</span> Found yourself working as lookout for a blind pirate captain a couple of months back?</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>Er, no... I mean... being on your own, wandering the world and such.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd><span class="action">grumbles</span> Best way to learn.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">clears their throat.</p>
  <p>That's what being in the company is to me, anyway.</p>
  <p class="action">gets up and goes to sit by the shore before waiting for an answer.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">grins and slaps Orin on the back</span> Well, ya not on your own none now, ya family, friend! Like it or no!</p>
  <p class="action">sighs as his hand whistles past the departing Orin.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The fish broth Biron prepares goes down easier than the seagull. And guards against the chilling night are creeping into the cave. You all feel the warmth of a good meal sitting in your guts as the weariness of your limbs commands attention.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">lays on his back on the sand, one hand on his full belly and drifts off to sleep.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">shouts to the others:</p>
  <p>I'll take first watch.</p>
  <p class="action">turns back to watch the waves.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks slightly surprised by this.</p>
  <p class="action">gets lower to the floor and nods.</p>
  <p>I'll take second.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron seems to fall asleep immediately, as is his manner. Soon followed by a weary Quinn. And so Orin's watch begins.</p>

<p>It is roughly midnight when Orin wakes Biron for his watch, nothing untoward other than flocks of birds having troubled their watch.</p>

<p>And so, in the pitch of night Biron wakes Quinn for the last watch before falling dead asleep again.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">grunts and dons his armour then slumps down in the low entryway with his bow over his lap.</dd>
</dl>

<p>At first much seems quiet. Gulls screech. The waves crash. It is peaceful, if cold.</p>

<p>Then you hear... something.</p>

<p>At first Quinn think it is then wind but as the sound gets louder... yes... it is clear... someone whistling a jaunty tune!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">crawls back into the cave and shakes Biron, then Orin.</p>
  <p>Wake up, someone comes!</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The pair wake with a start, a little weary to be startled at such an hour.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">wakes eyes wide and whips up to a (very tight) crouch position.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">grabs their bow and arrow, sneaking up to the edges of the cave, watching.</dd>
</dl>

  <p>Morgan rolled a 20 for Orin's Perception check.</p>

<p>The tide is still high, but with the little light from the embers of your fire you can see the narrow beach is empty.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">gestures to Orin to pull back a lil.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The sound of whistling is getting closer... and higher... it appears to be coming from the cliffs above: someone walking along the coastal path?</p>

<p>But who would be travelling at this hour?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">puts finger to his lips and pulls his shield off his back. presses against the walls of the cave.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd>
  <p><span class="action">grins apologetically</span> Well, sounded like a person, could be the wind whistling through the nooks and crinnies of the cliff some though...</p>
  <p class="action">lowers his voice and grins at Biron.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>I'm going to look.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd><span class="action">looks at Quinn and whispers.</span> Do you recognise the tune?</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">listens intently.</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">puts his hand towards Orin.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">crouches, nearly crawling along the cliffside...</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd>"Let me try. you keep your bow on me"</dd>
</dl>

<p>Now that Biron mentions it, it does sound familiar to Quinn. Perhaps a seafaring shanty, though Quinn cannot quite put his finger on which.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd>
  <p class="action">looks at Biron with concern.</p>
  <p>Okay.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">nods to him.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can now see a glow coming from the bluffs above, as though from a lantern.</p>

<p>It wavers about in the air, as though the holder is walking .</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">scratches his head</span> Sounds a bit like 'the fisherman's daughter'. You know it? It's a bit of a bawdy song, and no mistake. You'd know the chorus - makes it clear that shes the easiest catch some...</dd>
</dl>

  <p>Chris rolled a 20 for Biron's Stealth check.</p>
</aside>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">creeps from the cave and up slowly towards the sound.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd class="action">draws his bow and knocks an arrow, squinting to try and keep his eyes on Biron.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">tosses sand on the fire's coals.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Biron cautiously climbs the rocks leading back up to the path, quickly and quietly for a man of his size.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stays low and stays close to the rock face.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Coming along the coastal path you spy what appears to be a man wearing a tricorn hat. He carries a lantern hanging from the end of a long pole.</p>

<p>However, it is not him whistling!!</p>

<p>Upon his shoulder sits a black crow, whistling a tune like any human might.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">crouches low to the ground and behind some rocks and bushes and keeps an eye on them.</dd>
</dl>

<p>As he approaches you can see the man is clearly much enjoying his stroll. He swings his arm and steps forward as though without a care in the world, in tune to the crow's whistling.</p>

<p>A nasty looking mace hangs from his belt, but then who wouldn't carry a weapon in such a remote spot as this?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">looks for any tattoos, symbols or markings on the stranger or his weapons.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Nothing else untoward. He bears leather armour, and a coat that has seen better days. Its pockets jangle, perhaps with coin?</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">lays in waits. Looks down back to Orin to see how far away they are.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The man with the tricorn hat continues to pass by without a fuss, the whistling and light dimming into the distance.</p>

<p>Biron waits a while before he moves... but not before he catches a glimpse of something else moving down the path: four large folks, brandishing maces follow close behind, with obvious ill intent!</p>

<p>They do not appear to have seen you, but are following the man along the path.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">stays silent and watches.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The four men pass by, treading softly and carefully after the man with the crow.</p>

<p>They soon disappear into the night as well.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd class="action">moves back to the cave.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">looks to Biron</span> Anything of import?</dd>

<dt>Biron</dt>
<dd><span class="action">grunts</span> Nothin we need worry about.</dd>

<dt>Orin</dt>
<dd class="action">furrows their brow at Biron.</dd>

<dt>Quinn</dt>
<dd><span class="action">mutters</span> Ye ain't coming closer guv'nor.</dd>
